## Interested in Research?

I am always looking for motivated students interested in reinforcement learning, intelligent transportation, applied AI, or large language models. If you are a Skidmore student (or prospective student) curious about research opportunities, please don't hesitate to reach out.

## What I Look For

- Curiosity and willingness to learn new things
- Familiarity with Python programming (preferred, not required)
- Interest in AI/ML topics
- Ability to work both independently and collaboratively

## How to Get Involved

1. **Take a relevant course** — CS 318 (AI) or CS 376 (ML) are great starting points.
2. **Come to office hours** — Let's talk about your interests and potential projects.
3. **Send me an email** — Include a brief description of your interests and any relevant experience.

## Current Opportunities

- Independent study projects (Fall/Spring)
- Summer research assistantships (when available)
- Honors thesis advising
