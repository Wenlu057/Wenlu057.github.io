## What you'll do

- **Vibe-code with modern AI coding tools** (Copilot/Codex/Claude, etc.) to prototype quickly and iterate safely.
- Build **AI-for-trading / quantitative analysis** projects: data pipelines, feature engineering, backtesting, and risk-aware evaluation.
- Design and evaluate reinforcement learning agents for traffic management and safety.
- Train and test a **robot dog** for **locomotion and navigation** tasks (simulation-first; hardware when possible).
- Build reproducible ML pipelines, run experiments, and summarize findings.
- Optionally, write **trend-focused survey papers**: read recent work, synthesize insights, and produce a polished review.
- Collaborate in small teams; contribute to **clean code, reproducible experiments, and posters/papers**.

## What I look for

- Curiosity, reliability, and consistent communication.
- Interest in AI/ML and the social impact of computing.
- Python experience is helpful, but motivation and learning ability matter most.
- Willingness to read papers and iterate on feedback.

## How to apply (3 steps)

1. **Send an email** to [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}) with subject line: `Prospective RA – Your Name`.
2. **Attach** your unofficial transcript and 1-page résumé.
3. **Include links** to code/projects (GitHub, class projects, portfolios) plus a short paragraph on your research interests.

I typically reply within 1–2 weeks during the semester.
