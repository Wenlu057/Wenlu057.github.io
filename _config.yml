title_description: "Greetings! I am Wenlu Du, currently a Ph.D candidate in Comupter Science at <i class=\"fa fa-heart\"></i> <a href=\"https://njit.edu\">NJIT</a>. My focus is on integrating emerging reinforcement learning technologies into intelligent transportation systems, particularly advanced adaptive traffic signal control with an emphasis on enhancing traffic safety.
I'm being guided by Prof. <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~jingli\">Jing Li</a> and Prof. <a href=\"https://web.njit.edu/~gwang/\">Guiling (Grace) Wang</a>. Prior to my Ph.D., I spent two years <a href=\"https://www.alpine-usa.com/\">@ Alpine Electronics of America</a> as a software engineer, applying machine learning techniques to in-vehicle infortainment systems. I got my master's degree in Computer Science from WPI. 
I'm into <i class=\"fab fa-github\"></i><a href=\"https://github.com/Wenlu057\">coding</a>, writing and exploring new tehnologies. Outside of work, I relish the outdoors and all of nature's offerings, along with cherishing time spent with my 3-year-old daughter."
