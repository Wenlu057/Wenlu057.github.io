title_description: "Greetings! I am Wenlu Du, currently a Ph.D candidate in Comupter Science at <i class=\"fa fa-heart\"></i> <a href=\"https://njit.edu\">NJIT</a>. My focus is on integrating emerging reinforcement learning technologies into intelligent transportation systems, particularly advanced adaptive traffic signal control with an emphasis on enhancing traffic safety.
I'm being guided by Prof. Jing Li and Prof. Guiling (Grace) Wang. Prior to my Ph.D., I spent two years at Alpine Electronics of America as a software engineer, applying machine learning techniques to in-vehicle infortainment systems. I got my master's degree in Computer Science from WPI. 
I'm into coding, writing and exploring new tehnologies. Outside of work, I relish the outdoors and all of nature's offerings, along with cherishing time spent with my 3-year-old daughter."
